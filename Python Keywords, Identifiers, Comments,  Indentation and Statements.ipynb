    "2. Must Start with Letter or Underscore: An identifier must start with a letter (a-z, A-Z) or an underscore (_). It cannot start with a digit.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Case-sensitive: Python is case-sensitive, so uppercase and lowercase letters are considered different.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Cannot be a Keyword: Identifiers cannot be a reserved word or keyword used in Python. For example, you cannot name a variable \"if\" or \"def\" because these are keywords used for control structures.\n",

    "5. No Special Characters: Special characters like !, @, #, $, %, etc., are not allowed in identifiers.\n",

    "Ans. Comments in Python are lines of text in your code that are not executed when the program runs. They are used to make the code more readable and understandable for other developers (including yourself in the future). Comments are essential for documenting code, explaining its purpose, providing context, or temporarily disabling parts of the code during testing or debugging.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python supports two types of comments:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Single-line comments: These start with a hash character # and continue to the end of the line. They are typically used for short explanations or comments on a single line.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Multi-line comments: Python doesn't have a built-in syntax for multi-line comments like some other languages do (such as '/* */' in C or Java). However, developers often use triple quotes \"\"\" \"\"\" or ''' ''' to create multi-line string literals, which can serve as multi-line comments because they are not assigned to any variable and are ignored by the interpreter.\n",
